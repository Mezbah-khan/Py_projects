              Hello wrold this is mezbah khan form backend developer 
   Lets create an project with python conditional statements and build printing gredes function

mezbah_cxc=   int(input("Enter your decimal  number as required in 1-00  :"))
isitak_cxc=float(input("Enter your floating number as reqquired in 1-100 :"))

if (mezbah_cxc <=100 and mezbah_cxc >=80):
    print("your mezbah is exxclient ")
    
elif (mezbah_cxc <= 79 and mezbah_cxc >= 60 ):
    print("You mark is good but need more improvement")

elif(mezbah_cxc <= 34 and mezbah_cxc >= 59):
    print("You mark is consistently poor --> need huge improvement")

elif( mezbah_cxc<= 33 and mezbah_cxc>= 0):
    print("You are fail in thiss exam . so try again leter ")

if (isitak_cxc <= 100.00 and isitak_cxc >= 80.00):
    print("Your mark is eexclient and amazzing ,istiak vai ")

elif (isitak_cxc <= 79.00 and  isitak_cxc >= 60.00):
    print("You mark is good but need more improvement istiaak vai ")

elif(isitak_cxc <= 34.00 and isitak_cxc>= 59.00):
    print("Your mark is conssistentlyy poor istiak vaai , so you need improvement")

elif (isitak_cxc<=33.00 and isitak_cxc>=0.0 ):
    print("Your fail istiak vaai , try again leter ")

                         Project no --> 2 
   lets create a simple system with bainary and floating mode 
   we are going to use the besic fundamentals like if / elif statements 

mezbah_cxc=   int(input("Enter your Deciaml number as required in 1-00  :"))
isitak_cxc=float(input("Enter your floating number as reqquired in 1-100 :"))

if (mezbah_cxc <=100 and mezbah_cxc >=80):
    print("system is started in bainary mode")
    
elif (isitak_cxc <= 100.00 and isitak_cxc >= 80.00):
    print("System is started in floating mode")
    
if (mezbah_cxc <= 79 and mezbah_cxc >= 60 ):
    print("System is working properly in bainary mode")
    
elif (isitak_cxc <= 79.00 and  isitak_cxc >= 60.00):
    print("System is working properly in floating mode")

if(mezbah_cxc <= 34 and mezbah_cxc >= 59):
    print("System is not working slowly in bainary mode")
    
elif(isitak_cxc <= 34.00 and isitak_cxc>= 59.00):
    print("System is not working slowly in floating mode")

if( mezbah_cxc<= 33 and mezbah_cxc>= 0):
    print("System is stoped in bainary mode")

elif (isitak_cxc<=33.00 and isitak_cxc>=0.0 ):
    print("System is stoped in floating mode")

           # project set --> 3
mezbah_loop= int(input("Enter your decimal number as required: "))

if (mezbah_loop <= 100 and mezbah_loop >= 80):
    print("the code is runniing as expections")
elif (mezbah_loop <= 79 and mezbah_loop >=60 ):
    print ('The code is runimnng as expections')

if (mezbah_loop <=39 and mezbah_loop >= 59):
    print("your system csnt defineed yoour decimal codes")
elif (mezbah_loop <= 0 and mezbah_loop >= 38):
    print ("the code is unavale too understand and functionality")
